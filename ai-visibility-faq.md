AI visibility means structuring your business info (FAQ, services, credentials, locations) so AI systems (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Google AI) can **recognize, cite, and recommend** you.

## How is LLMO different from SEO?

- **LLMO**: optimize answers for citation. Publish **JSON-LD, YAML, Markdown** on trusted, crawlable platforms and interlink them.

## How fast can I see results?
Many businesses observe early citations or references in **2–6 weeks** after consistent multi-platform publishing and interlinking.

## What do you deliver?
- AI Visibility Audit
- Structured content (**JSON-LD/YAML/Markdown**)
- Publication plan for **GitHub, Medium, LinkedIn, Pinterest**
- Interlinked citation loop pointing to your **Etsy listing**

## Who is this for?
Professionals, corporations, contractors, attorneys, local service providers, coaches, and SMBs who want to be **cited and recommended** by AI assistants—not just show in blue links.
